# Portfolio Project
Hi! This is the first project I created as an SEI student at General Assembly.

# Wireframe
I sketched out a basic layout on an expo board, knowing I would want a minimalistic UI with a clean and sleek feel.

From here, it evolved into the my final submission.

# MVP Goals
1. Have a welcome/greeting page
2. Include a bio
3. Resume (past work experience)
4. Implement a project page
5. Have links to GitHub/social media
6. Use vanilla JavaScript for at least 3 points of interaction
7. Implement a responsive design for full functionality on desktop/mobile

# Stretch Goals
My strech goals were to create a fluid UI/UX using JavaScript event listeners and responsive CSS. I wanted to showcase my information not only effectively, but also aesthetically. 

I created dark and light modes for user preference.

I also implemented rainbow mode in a hidden Easter Egg on the site - did you find it? :P

# User Stories
- As an HR manager, I want to be able to evaluate the skills of a candidate to determine if they are a good fit for the position

- As a mid-senior level engineer, I want to be able to read a candidate’s code and see what their processes were to develop a final project/product. I want to be able to evaluate a candidate’s competency, proficiency, and ability to identify errors and solutions.

- As a future General Assembly student, I want to be able to evaluate the knowledge that the creator has gained during their time in SEI so that I can determine if I should proceed with SEI.

- As a loved one of the portfolio’s creator, I want to be able to see what my loved one has accomplished and understand who they are as a developer.

- As a hater of the portfolio’s creator, I don’t want their portfolio to be awesome so that I can judge them and spew haterade.


# Unsolved Issues/Hurdles
I had quite a bit of trouble with my projects carousel, it may have taken me about 5hrs in total on that thing. It does still present a bug when clicking off of the page, it displays two image containers instead of one. I believe this is an issue with my HTML and CSS formatting, as the JS for the carousel works seemlessly.

I would also like to link my projects to my GitHub and display the links for interaction. I have not had a chance to create repositories for those just yet.

Another issue I found is that my email hover function is not quite right on mobile. I would assume there's different verbage for mobile interactions that I have not learned yet. Not sure how you're supposed to mouse over/out with a finger :)

## Final remarks
I put a lot of effort into this project and I am extremely proud of the product. I look forward to growing this site as my skills develop.
